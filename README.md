At the bare minimum, you need a few key components to create a simple OS from scratch:

    Bootloader
        What it does: Sets up the CPU in a usable state (e.g., switching to protected mode on x86), then loads and transfers control to your kernel.
        Why it’s important: Without it, your OS can’t even start running; the CPU begins at firmware or BIOS code, and you need something to hand off execution to your kernel code.

    Kernel
        What it does: The kernel is your OS “core”—it’s the code that manages the CPU, handles interrupts, and provides basic services like memory handling.
        Why it’s important: It orchestrates all low-level tasks and provides an interface for higher-level functionality (even if minimal).

    Memory Management
        What it does: Reserves and tracks use of RAM, handles things like stack/heap allocation. In the simplest OS, this might just be a static region of memory.
        Why it’s important: Every running piece of code needs some memory. Even a toy OS needs a plan (however simple) for where data goes in RAM.

    Interrupts/Exceptions Handling
        What it does: Responds to hardware (e.g., keyboard input) and software events (e.g., CPU exceptions) in a controlled way.
        Why it’s important: Without handling interrupts, your OS can’t react to user input or hardware signals, and crashes/exceptions can’t be dealt with gracefully.

    Basic I/O (Device Drivers)
        What it does: Reads from and writes to devices, like the screen or keyboard. A minimal OS might just print text to the screen and read keystrokes.
        Why it’s important: You need a way to communicate with the outside world—at least a “Hello World” to prove it’s running!

    (Optional) Simple Shell or User Program
        What it does: Lets you run commands or see output interactively. In the simplest OS, this can be a single function that prints a prompt and checks for keyboard input.
        Why it’s important: It gives you a way to test higher-level functionality and prove your OS can handle multiple operations (beyond just kernel code).

That’s the minimal set: bootloader, a very basic kernel, some memory management, interrupt handling, and basic I/O. From there, you can gradually layer more features like file systems, process scheduling, networking, etc.
